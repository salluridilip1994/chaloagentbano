          <h3> Personal Accident Insurance</h3>
          <p>

Farhad was driving back to his office after meeting a client. As the traffic signal turned green, he turned towards his office building. Suddenly, there was a loud bang. A speeding bus had rammed into his car. Farhad was trapped inside. Onlookers rushed Farhad to the hospital. There, the doctors informed him that his fractures required him bed rest till it heals completely. That meant at least a month off from work. The person on the bed next to him, confused by Farhad’s calm reactions, asked why is he not worried? Farhad told him that though the injuries are painful, that is all he has to worry about because he has a good personal accident insurance. The other man, interested now asked how it works. “Personal accident insurance is a policy that can reimburse your medical costs, provide compensation in case of disability or death caused by accidents. There are other benefits too that you can get with an IPA insurance” said Farhad, continueing with the following:<br>

 

<b>1. Accidental death:</b> <br>If the policyholder dies in an accident then his nominee gets accidental death compensation. The family is financially secure in this situation. The compensation can vary from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 1 crore.<br>

 

<b>2. Permanent total disability in an accident:</b><br> At times, despite medical help the victim becomes disabled for life. Then the insurance policy pays a certain amount depending upon the nature of the disability. The policy also covers loss of speech, loss of vision in both eyes, and hearing loss in both ears.<br>

 

<b>3. Permanent partial disability:</b><br> This is applicable if a person has partially lost their hearing in one ear or suffered eyesight loss in one eye. Or, it could be that the policyholder has lost an index finger, a thumb, or even a hand. In all these cases, the policyholder can approach the insurer for a claim.<br>

 

<b>4. Transportation benefit:</b><br> Some insurers also grant a family transportation benefit. Say, the insured person is in a hospital outside 150 km of his home. The immediate family member will incur certain transportation expenses to reach the hospital. The insurance will reimburse these expenses up to a maximum of Rs 50,000.<br>

 

<b>5. Further benefits:</b><br> The insurance covers other factors like education and employment benefits, and funeral expenses. You also get coverage for hospital charges, including ambulance costs. Some policies offer an educational allowance and home or vehicle alteration benefits.<br>

 

Before buying your policy, you must keep these things in mind<br>

 

Important dates: An accident insurance policy provides a free-look period of 15 days. This allows you to cancel the policy within that period. There is a ‘grace period’ of 30 days for policy renewal.<br>

 

Exclusions: Your insurer will not cover any loss arising out of acts of war or terror. It will not cover any claims regarding existing physical disabilities or pre-existing diseases. The exclusions also comprise mental disorders, HIV or AIDS, and congenital anomalies. The insurer will not honour any intentional injury claims. Any injuries arising from participation in adventure sports come under exclusions as well. This includes activities like bungee jumping, mountaineering, and river rafting.

          <h3>Motor Insurance</h3>
          <p>Motor insurance Introduction This is an introductory guide to provide you with a better understanding of what motor insurance is and what you must know when buying motor insurance policies and making claims.<br> Types of motor policies When you buy a motor vehicle, you need to buy a motor insurance. There are, however, many types of motor insurance policies available. The common types are: •Third party cover - This policy insures you against claims for bodily injuries or deaths caused to other persons (known as the third party), as well as loss or damage to third party property caused by your vehicle. 
            <br>•Third party, fire and theft cover - This policy provides insurance against claims for third party bodily injury and death, third party property loss or damage, and loss or damage to your own vehicle due to accidental fire or theft.
            <br> •Comprehensive cover - This policy provides the widest coverage, i.e. third party bodily injury and death, third party property loss or damage and loss or damage to your own vehicle due to accidental fire, theft or an accident<br>

Exclusions/extensions A standard motor insurance will not cover certain losses, such as your own death or bodily injury due to a motor accident, your liability against claims from passengers in your vehicle (except for passengers of hired vehicles such as taxis and buses) and loss or damage arising from an act of nature, such as flood, storm and landslide. <br>However, you may pay additional premiums to extend your policy to cover flood, landslide, landslip as well as cover your passengers. It is important to check your policy for the exclusions.<br>

Insured value/sum insuredIf you are buying a policy against loss/damage to your vehicle, you must ensure that your vehicle is adequately insured as it will affect the amount you can claim in the event of loss/damage. For a new vehicle, the insured value will be the purchase price while for other vehicles, the insured value is the market value of the vehicle at the point you apply for the insurance policy.<br> •Under-insurance – If you insure your vehicle at a lower sum than its market value, you will be deemed as self-insured for the difference, i.e. in the event of loss/damage, you will only be partially compensated (up to the proportion of insurance) by your insurance company. <br>•Over-insurance – Should you insure your vehicle at a higher sum than its market value, the maximum compensation you will receive is the market value of the vehicle as the policy owner cannot ‘profit’ from a motor insurance claim. Duty of disclosure Duty of disclosureYou should disclose fully all material facts, including previous accidents (if any), modification to engines, etc.<br>  When in doubt as to whether a fact is relevant or not, it is best to ask your insurance company.<br>  If you fail to disclose any material fact, your insurance company may refuse to pay your claim or any claim made by a third party against you. In such cases, you are personally liable for such claims. <br>PriceThe price you pay for your motor insurance will depend on the type of policy selected. The insurance premium charged by your insurance company is the standard minimum rate in accordance with the Motor Tariff. <br>However, in addition to the standard minimum rate, your insurance company may impose additional premiums known as loadings to the premium payable in view of higher risk factors involved such as age of vehicle and claims experience. <br>Loadings are governed by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and no insurance company may charge loadings higher than the levels permitted by BNM.
